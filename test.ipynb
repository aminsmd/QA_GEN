The school plans to assign a group of 50 students such that the number of students in each bus is the same between trips.

We can try different combinations:\\\\n\\\\n1. Bus A (20) + Bus C (15) + Bus E (10) = 45 < 50\\\\n2. Bus B (25) + Bus D (30) = 55 > 50\\\\n3.

Bus D (30) + Bus E (10) + either A or C = 30 + 10 + 15 or 30 + 10 + 20 = 45 < 50\\\\n\\\\nUpon testing these configurations, only the combination of Bus A and Bus B adds up to 50. That configuration is:\\\\n\\\\n* Bus A (20) + Bus B (25)\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, this is the only valid configuration because the total student number must add up to exactly 50, using the available buses only once.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, there is only one way to assign the students into the buses such that each bus is used once, and the bus capacities cannot be exceeded.\",\"answer\":\"1\"}', 'name': 'simple_teacher', 'role': 'assistant'}\n",
